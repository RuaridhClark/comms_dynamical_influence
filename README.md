# comms_dynamical_influence
Community detection based on dynamical influence, as described in "Network communities of dynamical influence".

**CDI.m** - communities of dynamical influence (CDI) divides a network into communities by first revealing the most effective vertices for spreading information and leading the network, see [1], and then populating communities with nodes that are under the influence of these influential vertices.
